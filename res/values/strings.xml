You can always redo the tour through the settings menu.\n\nSo, would you like to see how it works?</string>
    <string name="c2dm_new_feature_idea">If you selected an station which already had bikes, you have probably received a notification by now!\n\nAssume you don\'t mind waiting for an station to have a bike for you. You might be on a cafe, or chatting with a friend. Using this, you don\'t need to be continuously checking for the status on that station, just wait for CityBikes to notify you through Google\'s awesome C2DM service, even if the application is closed!\nYou can add as many alarms as you want. When you receive a notification, all other alarms will be automatically cleared.\n\nThis is an EXPERIMENTAL alpha feature.\n\nIf you want to provide any feedback, contact me on twitter @ctbikes or through email.\n\nThanks for taking this tour, and have a great time!</string>
