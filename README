This is a version that only works on Paris.

With its name, openVelib, it gets better visibility inside Android Market

Also, it has been pretty popular, so ditching all its userbase right
now is not an option. At some point, a transaction popup (openVelib -> CityBikes) would be nice.

I am moving openVelib to the codebase of CityBikes, to keep updates easy

Haters Gonna Hate!
=======
This is the main version of CityBikes

Other projects (as openBicing, openVelib, hang and should be updated from here, somehow, will have to ask the git wizards for info)
